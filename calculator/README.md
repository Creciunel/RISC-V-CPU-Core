<h1>TL-Verilog Calculator</h1>
<p>Welcome to the TL-Verilog Calculator project!</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This calculator is implemented in TL-Verilog and simulated in Makerchip. It supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
<p>The calculator retrieves the result of each operation and uses it as the first operand for the next operation, enabling chained calculations.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.</li>
        <li>Chained calculations: Result of each operation is automatically used as the first operand for the next operation.</li>
    </ul>
